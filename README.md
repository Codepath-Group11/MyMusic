# Group Project 4 - *MyMusic*

The app is a music playlist location based aggregator. A user downloads the app, signs in to any one
of the popular music services and the user is then asked to categorize their location. Any category
can be entered such as work, home or the gym then a playlist of music is displayed and played through the app.
