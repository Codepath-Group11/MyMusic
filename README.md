# Group Project 4 - *MyMusic*

The app makes selecting an activity playlist in spotify very simple, easy and more intuitive. A user downloads the app and signs in to spotif/fitbit. A User's fitbit most frequent activites will be displayed. When tapping on an activity, the user can access all of the top curated content from spotify in one playlist that is related to that selected activity.
